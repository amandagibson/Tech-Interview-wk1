# Week 1 Assessment
You have 30 minutes to complete the assessment. You can look wherever you want for help with your answers (Google, StackOverflow, course materials, etc.), as long as you do not ask me (the coach) for help. Create a folder named week_1_assessment and add a text file where you can write down your answers.

As you work on this exercise, please 'think aloud.' That means verbally describing your mental process as it develops, including the doubts and questions you have, the solution strategies you consider, and the reasons that justify your decisions.

Think Aloud Protocol
The 'Think-aloud' protocol involve the participant thinking aloud as he or she are performing a set of specified tasks or working on an excercise. The participant are asked to say whatever comes into his/her mind as he complete the task. This might include what he/she is looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling. This gives the coach valuable insight into the participant's cognitive processes (rather than only their final product), to make thought processes as explicit as possible during task performance. Sessions should be recorded so that coaches can go back and refer to what participants did and how they reacted.<br><br>

1. <b>Question 1 - Variables</b><br>
Create a variable and set it equal to 'variable'.<br>
What are some different data types? Write a few examples.<br>
- <b>DONE</b>

2. <b>Question 2 - Hashes and Arrays</b><br> 
Open irb. We're going to make some cars.<br>
Create two hashes, one for each car, with the following attributes: wheels, max_speed, color.<br>
Create an array that contains both cars.<br>
How do we use the array to access the second car?<br>
How do we find the second car's color?<br>
- <b>DONE</b>

3. <b>Question 3 - Classes and Methods</b><br> 
Create a new folder called cars and inside of that folder, create a file called car.rb with:<br>
a class Car<br>
a method to "paint" a car a new color.<br>
Open irb. Load your 'car.rb' file.<br>
Create an instance of a Car and change its color.<br>
- <b>DONE</b>

4. <b>Question 4 - Rspec</b><br>
(Please use your text file to put your answers in)  <br>
 How do you initialize rspec in a folder? Do it in our cars folder.<br>
We would ordinarily have written our tests first, then written code to make them pass. Why? <br>
Create a unit test for our Car class to test our "painting" method.<br>
A car should have a driver. Create an instance_double Driver. <br>
Write a second test for this and make it pass. </i>
